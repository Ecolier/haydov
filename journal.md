**What I did**
- Diagram of maps flow (routing & geocoding orchestration)

**What I learned**
- QS can encode complex data as URL params, ensuring readability and caching
- Private services and internet-facing services must live on different networks

**Bugs/Challenges**
- Need to develop principled anti-spoofing techniques to avoid abuse, ensuring legitimacy of discounts while preserving user experience 

**Next up**
- Orchestrate routing & geocoding through a unified maps API
- Use Traefik as an API gateway
- (Look into PlantUML to generate diagrams)
